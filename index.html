        <p>The NBA has officially switched from Spalding to Wilson as their Official Game Ball. The players didn't love it at first but now they have grown to like it. Unfortunately the NBA still uses leather in their basketballs. Leather is an outdated material, which we have created much better vegan leather to replace it </p>

        <h2>Dribbling wasn't allowed back then</h2>   
        <P>In the original rules players could not bounce the ball. In 1901, the rule was enacted permitting players to bounce the ball one time. </P>

        <h2>James Naismith invented basketball</h2>

        <p>Naismith's secretary typed up the rules and tacked them on the bulletin board. A short time later, the gym class met, and the teams were chosen with three centers, three forwards, and three guards per side. Two of the centers met at mid-court, Naismith tossed the ball, and the game of “basket ball” was born.</p>

        <h2>The Games was way shorter back then - 5 min quarters</h2>

        <p>In NBA each quarter played for 12 minutes. As the sum of 4 quarters equals to 48 minutes. If the end of the game scores are leveled then additional OT  over time will be given which will had 5 minutes, if again the scores are leveled again same process goes on till the one team leads another team in scoring.</p>

            <p>In higher levels of college and professional basketball, officials wear a timing device on the belt-line called PTS Precision Timing System The device is used by on-court officials to start and stop the game clock in a timely manner, rather than waiting for the scoreboard operator (timekeeper) to do so.</p>
